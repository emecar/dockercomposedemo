Containerizing Django App with Docker Compose
==============================================
Docker Compose is typically used for multiple containers. docker-compose.yml is used to configure services that comprise these application parts

1. Download starter file and Identify project root folder and run vscode from there.

2. Create docker-compose.yml file in the outer folder hello_django_docker_compose/ (NOT in App folder) 
		version: "3.8"
		services:
		  web:
			build: ./app
			command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
			volumes:
			  - ./app/:/usr/src/app/
			ports:
			  - 8000:8000
3. Build the Docker image and start/stop container from CLI
		docker compose up -d
4. Verify and operate
	docker ps  //how any docker containers that are running on the system
	docker compose ps // only show containers created from images built from the docker-compose.yml file in the current directory, or any parent directory. 
	docker compose stop 
				// no container ID is required as an argument. It will stop all containers that were started with the docker compose up command
				//Also, where docker stop <containerID> can be used from any directory, in order to use the docker compose stop command, you must be in the same directory as the docker-compose.yml file that was used to start the containers, or a child directory. 
	docker compose down
				//is a shortcut to both docker compose stop and docker compose rm in a single command.
